a= range(10)
print a[::-1]  ---> returns a new reversed list.List is not mutated ,new list is obtained.

'in' can be used in any python datatype for membership testing.

a.sort()   ---> new MUTATED sorted list
a.sorted() ---> neww sorted list .NOT MUTATED.

ALways code in python on pythonic style

for eg : consider repetition in python . for this , the order of preference must be ---> 1) list comprehension
         2) for loop
         3) while loop

Output list is obtained by doing some transformation on input list.

DICTIONARY is a set of Keys and Values.
a={} --> empty dictionary .

dictionary is a MUTABLE datastructure. it is not ordered. its mainly used for LOOKUP of a value . therefore no relevance in order. Keys HAS to be associated with Values.


LIST and DICTIONARY CANNOT be used as a key in dictionary.

possible keys of a dictionary ---> int,str,tuple----> immutable datatypes
keys NOT possible on dictionary --> list,dict-----> mutable datatypes

Keys HAVE to be MUTABLE. Values can be anything.

dictionary is also called maps,associative arrays,hash.

some builtin dict functions--> a.key(), a.value(), a.item().

comprehension is also possible on  a dictionary.
