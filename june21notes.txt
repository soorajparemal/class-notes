if there is no local variable for ,say x, what we see is the global variable.
If there is local variable,it will SHADOW the global variable.

In most cases we can guess the way a programme will act from reading the code.
But UnboundLocalError is an error which cannot be understood easily .

2 steps associated with python compilation:
	1) checks the syntax and generate the BYTE code using python COMPILER.
	2) run the Byte code using the Python Virtual Machine.

Having a lot of global variable in  our programme is not a good thing to do.
	it creates a lot of dependancies.Any modification in a global variable will affect other functions in the programme. We dont have to worry about this in case of local variables.

() ---> function call operator.
There is no issue if we just write function name without the function call operator.


Function name can be assigned to ANY variable and can be accesed through that variable.

Functions are "First Class Entities" ::--> ie, any type of manipulations that can be done on a python object can be done on a Function.

A functions body is its MACHINE code(byte code in case of python) .

we can use call operators inside a function inorder to use a function as a parameter to another function.

functions operatinf upon other functions are called "Higher Order Functios".
